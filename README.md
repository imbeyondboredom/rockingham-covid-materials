# Documentation for the Rockingham, VA ad-hoc face shield manufacturing group

## Introduction
If you're reading this and you want to help us make face shields then please read everything here so that you have the information to help

## Mission
We're not trying to deliver masks - we're trying to keep our healthcare professionals and friends safe.

This is important to remember - *if for any reason you suspect the masks to be compromised then do not deliver them.*

## Agreement
By working with this group you agree to manufacture all shields while wearing gloves and a mask as per the prusa official guidelines
- Act as if you were infected by the COVID-19 virus. Wear a face mask and a fresh pair of gloves when collecting each batch of printed parts. Store the parts immediately in a sealable bag.
- Talk with whoever you’re making the shields for, let them know about your manufacturing environment
- There is still debate about how long the virus survives on plastic, but most sources mention 2-3 days. That means that by letting the packed face shields sit for 2-3 days before distributing them, you’ll greatly reduce risk of transmission
- Do not store the entire stock in one place, minimize the risk of cross-contamination
